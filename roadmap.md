## 1-Year Roadmap to Becoming a Backend Software Developer with Go üë®‚Äçüíª


#### May 15th 2023 - May 15th 2024 üöÄ

### Introduction

Becoming a software developer requires time, patience, and dedication. In this roadmap, we'll focus on learning Go and building projects that apply the concepts learned in the language. However, before diving into Go, it's important to understand the fundamentals of programming and the internet. It's also important to document your learning journey and network with other people in the tech community.

### Preparatory Steps

1. The importance of learning how to learn. Read this article that explains and gives practical steps on [how to learn](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/how-to-learn-anything). Also, watch this video that talks about [how to learn coding in 2023](https://youtu.be/tcpO1UWP2Mg)

2. The importance of documenting the process and journey of learning. Sign up on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) or [Dev Community](https://dev.to/)


3. The importance of understanding the basics of programming in general before learning a particular language. Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/zOjov-2OZ0E) that explains the basics.

4. Have a basic understanding of [how the web and internet work](https://youtu.be/hJHvdBlSxug) and understand the difference between [Frontend and Backend](https://youtu.be/EN6pkqiJ1as)

5. Learn Git and GitHub for version control. Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/tRZGeaHPoaw) for an introduction.

6. Understand the importance of networking, joining tech communities, and engaging in physical/virtual tech events. Be active and share your journey on social media and connect with other people in the tech space on LinkedIn and Twitter. Check out these resources:

## Roadmap Flow

The roadmap will follow a structured approach that combines learning, practical projects, and documentation. Here's a breakdown of what to expect each week:

- For the first three weeks, we'll cover the basics of Go programming language and its syntax, data types, and control structures.

- We'll then proceed to work on a project based on what was learnt in the previous three weeks. Projects will be aimed at practical application of the concepts learned and will include building a command-line application, RESTful API, and a web application.

- At the end of each three-week period, an article will be published on either Dev.to or Hashnode or both, documenting what was learned and the process of building the project.

- This cycle will continue for a year, with each three-week period focusing on a specific set of concepts, project, and documentation. By the end of the year, you will have a solid foundation in Go programming and practical experience in building various applications.

## Week 1 - 3 (May 15th - 5th June 2023)

#### Resource:

- [Go programming full course with Bonus projects](https://youtu.be/un6ZyFkqFKo)

#### Concepts to Learn

- Introduction to Go

- Basic syntax and data types in Go

- Variables and constants

- Control structures (if, for, switch)

- Functions and methods

- Arrays, slices, and maps

#### Project

- Building a command-line application that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

#### Article Topic



- **Week 1 - Article**: Write an article titled "Transitioning to Backend Software Development with Go" that discusses the reasons for choosing this career path, the expectations and goals for the next year, and the importance of documenting the learning journey. The article should be published on either dev.to or Hashnode or both.
- Also share the article on LinkedIn and Twitter, and write a post about your decision to begin your software development journey.

This is the first iteration, the roadmap will be continually updated. Thank you.
