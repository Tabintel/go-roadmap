# Backend Software Developer Roadmap with Go ü§ñ

Welcomeüòé  to the Backend Software Developer Roadmap with Go! This roadmap is designed to guide complete beginners on the path to becoming proficient in backend software development with the Go programming language in just one year. It is divided into 52 weeks, with each week focusing on specific concepts to be learnt, a project to work on, and an article to document the learning process.

## Getting Started 

Before starting this roadmap, it is important to understand some basic programming concepts, including how the web and internet work, and the difference between front-end and back-end development. You should also have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub for version control. 

To make the most out of this roadmap, it is recommended that you join tech communities, attend virtual or physical tech events, and engage with others in the tech space. Additionally, documenting your learning journey is an important step in keeping yourself accountable, tracking progress, and seeing growth over time.

## Roadmap Flow üõ£Ô∏è  

The roadmap is designed to follow this flow:

- Concepts to be learnt for the first three weeks

- A project to work on based on what was learnt

- An article to be published on either dev.to or Hashnode or both that documents what was learnt and the process

## Documentation üìã

The first article you will write using this roadmap should focus on your decision to transition to backend software development with Go, and the expectations you have for the journey ahead. You should emphasize the importance of documenting your progress and the benefits it will bring. 

Here is an example title for your article: "Why I Decided to Transition to Backend Software Engineering with Go: Expectations and Benefits of Documenting My Journey"

## Conclusion
